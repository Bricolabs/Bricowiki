## WyrdWeb vision

WyrdWeb was founded in 2005 by Graham Oakes, Willem van den Ende
and Nynke Etk Fokma with a vision to grow Wyrdweb into a network of
creative businesses and communities around the world, that are
alive and connected in in(ter)dependent networks, featuring our
respective congruent passions and dreams. A fun and enjoyable
virtual
[open space](http://www.openspaceworld.org/ "http://www.openspaceworld.org/")
where creative people like ourselves can learn from one another and
showcase their products and services for congruent sustainable
living, and people can create an agenda of issues to work on
together.

## Guiding principles and values

[![Image:Essentials2.png](essentials2.png)](image_essentials2.html "Image:Essentials2.png")

-   [We despise interest](http://www.gmlets.u-net.com/ "http://www.gmlets.u-net.com/")
-   [Agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/ "http://agilemanifesto.org/")

## WyrdWeb mission

To support creative people running and maintaining their own sites
and communities with confidence. Whether we guide, consult, coach,
or build together with people, we wish to put ourselves out of a
job, as soon as humanely possible. We don't take hostages.

## WyrdWeb slogan

It's all about communication, the rest is open source software!

## Current operations

### Resources

We run three servers in Germany with Debian GNU/Linux. One is our
spike server where we experiment, develop and support community
sites, the other is our stable server where we serve small creative
businesses, including our own. Most of the software (all open
source) we work with is MySQL, PHP and Javascript based, and on the
spike server we experiment with other, less mature, yet for the
future possibly interesting new languages and softwarez.

### Creative users and communities

Our users/community members are
[creative and innovative businesses and communities](http://www.wyrdweb.eu/about-us/mission/users/ "http://www.wyrdweb.eu/about-us/mission/users/")
with a passion for their own products and services.

### Social networking

We weave in a lot of that, and actively participate in communities
to figure out resonance and how to support freedom and creativity
better. We may not believe (exactly) what others believe in, and we
don't have to in order to support a user/community purpose, as long
as what we believe in is respected too. Example:
[Turning tides](http://satirnetwork.ning.com/profiles/blog/show?id=2249466:BlogPost:506/ "http://satirnetwork.ning.com/profiles/blog/show?id=2249466%3ABlogPost%3A506/").

Listing all social networks where we are active seems silly so we
just mention three of the ning social networking sites where we
have posted the Weaver Bird document:

-   [Mystical Temple Coven](http://mysticaltemplecoven.ning.com/xn/detail/2083447:Topic:3972 "http://mysticaltemplecoven.ning.com/xn/detail/2083447:Topic:3972")
-   [My Revolution Space](http://myrevolutionspace.ning.com/profiles/blog/show?id=2215351:BlogPost:749 "http://myrevolutionspace.ning.com/profiles/blog/show?id=2215351%3ABlogPost%3A749")
-   [Satir Network](http://satirnetwork.ning.com/profiles/blog/show?id=2249466:BlogPost:105/ "http://satirnetwork.ning.com/profiles/blog/show?id=2249466%3ABlogPost%3A105/")

### Active Wyrdweb builders

Anjez\*, Graham, Hans, Ira, Marc, Nynke, Pat, Ushie, and Willem.

## Future

This is the
[Wyrdweb site](http://www.wyrdweb.eu/ "http://www.wyrdweb.eu/")
that, over the years, became somewhat cluttered. We are currently
getting a new server and refactoring our wyrd selves to be more
lean, and working on a very focused
[new wyrdweb site](http://drupal6.spike.wyrdweb.eu/ "http://drupal6.spike.wyrdweb.eu/")
to reflect that.

### Security

Nynke has discerned some
[web 2.0 issues](http://www.wyrdweb.eu/web-20-security-issues/ "http://www.wyrdweb.eu/web-20-security-issues/")
in general that she intends (wants to) to work on. And selfcare
comes first. She also has to pay her bills.Â :-)

### More people

The active Wyrdweb builders are nearly all independents, and we do
this next to our work. We are overloaded and behind on upgrading
and updating of our stable server and softwares used, and on social
networking.
