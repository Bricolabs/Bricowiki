			<p>Openwaves: Invitation - Call4Chaptres - research on wifi - abstract due by 15th May  
</p><p>'a chapter for a book on research on free wireless networks
<a href="http://www.openwaves.ws/network.htm" class="external free" title="http://www.openwaves.ws/network.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.openwaves.ws/network.htm</a>
</p><p>this page can be used to describe bricophones or any new project related with wifi, gsm, rfid or openspectrum issues. 
</p>
<pre>- 1. Intro 
        Bricolabs 'network of networks'
</pre>
<pre>- 2. Broader framework
       Current theories, 'social hardware'
       Threats to open infrastructure - ACTA
</pre>
<p>ANTI-COUNTERFEITING TRADE AGREEMENT -  Jean-Noel Montagne
Free wireless access can be closed anytime, or censored by local or national authorities with habitual pretexts like terrrorism, security or pedonazism, whatever. Some laws are in preparation in France, and maybe everywhere with ACTA, to close free wifi networks, officialy to fight piracy (and pedonazis...)
For me, the most important thing in free networks is the possibility for the network to be technically and politically transformed in a free mesh network with no centralisation of the management, self-coordination, direct exchange from one citizen to another...: just add a cell in the network, and this cell will communicate and route the other communications, even with low bandwith...don't need to route 3D High Definition docs but raw text...
</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement" class="external free" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Counterfeiting_Trade_Agreement</a>
</p><p>FINALLY, AFTER YEARS OF SECRECY, THE TEXT OF THE ANTI-COUNTERFEITING TRADE AGREEMENT (ACTA) HAS BEEN MADE PUBLIC.
</p><p>While this is a definitive victory for the countless activists who pressed for transparency, the officially released text makes it crystal clear that our worst fears about this international agreement are real:
</p><p>ACTA is not just about counterfeiting. ACTA targets citizens' ability to use the Internet to communicate, collaborate and create, and it poses significant concerns for citizens' privacy, freedom of expression and fair use rights.
</p><p>For EFF's preliminary analysis of the official ACTA text:

</p>
<pre>- 3. Practices  which can be further expanded in this chapter
</pre>
<p>We do care about technical details but we would like to stress social (to use a quick but not accurate distinction between technical and social) effects and their implications on everyday life.
</p>
<hr />
<pre>I have created two sets of questions - for each practice to be represented and open for discussion
</pre>
<p>1. Which practices would you describe can best represent the idea of an autonomy of open waves?
2. How does here knowledge sharing, open source and free wifi infrastructure enable solidarity?
</p>

<p>SATTELITES
</p><p>"Computer Science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.
E. W. Dijkstra"
</p><p>Hardware from scratch, Live coding, Biofeedback, reclaiming the streets, history of free software culture in a performance...
</p><p>Singing open source code: dmesg > /dev/dsp  &amp;&amp; my shell  had spit a byte chunk of a song...
</p><p>Artisans of bits and volts, humanist poets, nomadic scientists - where are we going? I trust in the pulse of your steps, our revolution is the next second, and the constant challenge is not to surrender to the conformity of being entertained or entertaining: distracting the fact that we want to live beyond history, walls, banks, genetic similarity. We want an ecosystem that is worth of all this Prometheic pyrotechinic - this being, which is supposed to be Sapiens. Some intelligent symbiosis to keep this flame heating an harmonic environment.
</p><p>But, if today we still looking at some of us marching for a piece of land to survive or alienating their most creative instincts in a desperate search for exist inside a culture of self-destructive consumption, we have to ask: What's the role of those sheltered and fed in thinking about an autonomy in knowledge and information transmition for those efforts that wants revert this pulsion of humanity self-destructive greed?
</p><p>The conjecture of this manifesto is inside a function pointing to a cracking sparkle at the horizon: The day we will be able to build our first handmade satellite and send it to this sidereal space wich is already full of corporative and governamental devices. Will our satellite be able to transform our networks in something more autonomous? Or we have to re-think all technocracy to reach that by a tottaly different path? How?
</p><p>We're more than technocracy guinea pigs!
</p><p>Dreaming and dancing: the march of the Satelitteless..

TIBETAN grassroots mesh network (INDIA) - Jerneja Rebernak
</p><p>Which practices would you describe can best represent the idea of an autonomy of open waves?
</p><p>It becomes impossible to shift attention from the everyday materiality, and political-social engagement while researching media in India.  Being displaced across many states, the Tibetan community in India, has learned to overcome the geographical distances and still reflect and  maintain its tradition, religion, language and culture using wifi infrastructure.  Due to the fact that Tibetans were displaced across several different regions in India, Internet access became a bridge for communities. Specifically for the rural communities in India, cable and optic fiber becomes an aimless effort for efficient infrastructure.  During the years of the early internet connections in 1998-1999, the Tibetan News network that consisted of a mailing list initiated by the Tibetans in Canada was being printed and placed on a message board in smaller villages. Ten years later, the Tibetan Technological Centre in collaboration with Airjaldi, a social enterprise, has established Dharamsala Community wireless-mesh network. This network  interconnects more than 2,000 computers located within a 60 Km. radius around Dharamsala using 30 locally developed routers based on modified low-cost consumer hardware and locally-brewed software. The network offers a wide variety of services to its users including broadband Internet access, VoIP-based telephone services, file sharing, offsite backup, etc. (<a href="http://www.dalailamafoundation.org/dlf/en/airjaldi.jsp" class="external free" title="http://www.dalailamafoundation.org/dlf/en/airjaldi.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.dalailamafoundation.org/dlf/en/airjaldi.jsp</a>) 
</p><p>How does here knowledge sharing, open source and free wifi infrastructure enable solidarity?
</p><p>Due to their Diaspora, Tibetans are actively focused on communication technologies to maintain  their status of political unity, spiritual and linguistic traditions. Media experiences here are intertwined with the everyday life, while adaptations to technologies reflect cultural and economic needs. Linked to these immediate needs, locative media have enabled do it yourself grassroots cultural practices within Tibetan communities, and digital outreach  has as well empowered the community. In this way, through collective actions like webcasting programmes, online run-information portals and artistic festivals were initiated. In it's 10th year, the Free Spirit festival a contemporary arts and culture festival, is an example of such activity. The  necessity of maintaining flows of information and community awareness has interconnected the dimension of physical access to technology to preservation of cultural heritage. Processes of collaboration and dissemination of infrastructure should therefore foster reflectiveness outside its status of material good,  becoming an enriching part of the cultural dimension of communities and tribes.

Vision - global communication system
</p>
<hr />
<p>Translating Rafael Diniz's e-mail into english:
</p><p>On the possibility os a global communication system with no corporations or state control, free.
</p><p>This is a proposal for a free communication network, without the use of proprietary infrastructure from either capitalist corporations or the state. It consists of 1) broadcast (free radio and free tv); 2) point to point access terminals (free GSM mobile network); and 3) IP network (free internet); it is an heterogeneous infrastructure that in a dynamic way configures itself in a global network of free communication.
</p><p>Follows the description of a possible interconnection architecture for the communication system, considering that the division by frequencies is rather "raw", as the suggested forms of modulation are only examples:
</p><p>For long distance communication networks:
</p><p>In short wave (3Mhz - 30Mhz), using analogic modulation (fonia) and digital (from CW to OFDM, etc.) to broadcast data between far territories, as different continents, respecting the conditions for signal propagation (that in some moments could not exist) that want to establish communication.
</p><p>For medium distances:
</p><p>In short-, medium- (300khz-3Mhz) and long-wave (30khz-300khz) lenghts, using analogic (fonia) and digital (CW... OFDM) modulation to broadcast data between cities and countries in the same region.
</p><p>For short distances:
</p><p>In VHF (30Mhz-300Mhz), UHF (300MHz-3GHz) and SHF (3GHz-30GHz), using mainly means of digital modulation that allow high transmission rates - like the systems WiMax (802.16) and Wi-Fi (802.11) - to broadcast data within a city or region.
</p><p>About the network access points:
</p><p>With these networks for connections, we can have the local emission points in broadcast, and they can have global communication, the access terminals (mobile phones) being interconnected using a routing that can or not establish communication (in the case of intercontinental calls, there are moments in which it is not possible to create the link with short waves - the call can fail) and the IP network, that will be a free internet, having as access terminals the devices equipped with WiFi and Wimax mainly.
</p><p>Free radio and tv we already know.
</p><p>Global communication in diverse frequency ranges is dominated since decades by the million amateur radio operators all over the world (BTW, amateur radio already does for more than 80 years the kind of point to point communication internet does today).
</p><p>GSM networks (built with SDR [2] platforms - like USRP [3] + GNU Radio [4] - running Optrn BTS [5]) and IP networks (built with Wi-Fi and WiMax equipment) are possible with affordable transmission equipment and knowledge on radio waves propagation.
</p><p>And this infrastructure, put together with horizontal, de-centralised and assymetrical ways of managing the network, leaves unnecessary the allocation of so large band of the eletromagnetic spectrum for corporations under state supervision.
